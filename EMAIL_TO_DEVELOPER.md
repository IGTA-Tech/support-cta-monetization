**Subject:** New Project: Support CTA Implementation Across IGTA-Tech Sites (8 Priority Sites + 14 Additional)

---

Hi [Developer Name],

I have a new project for you that involves adding a universal "Support & Build With Us" button across our deployed websites. This is a straightforward implementation that should take **3-4 hours for the priority sites** and **13-19 hours total** if we decide to roll it out to all projects.

## 🎯 Project Overview

**Goal:** Add a floating support CTA button (bottom-right corner) to all our live websites that links to our support hub.

**What it looks like:**
- Minimal pill-style button
- Fixed position bottom-right
- Text: "Support & Build With Us"
- Links to: `https://support.innovativeautomations.dev/`
- Auto dark/light mode support
- Fully accessible (keyboard navigation, screen readers)
- Configurable via environment variables

## 📋 What I'm Sending You

I've prepared **3 comprehensive documents** with everything you need:

### 1. **DEVELOPER_CTA_IMPLEMENTATION_BRIEF.md** (Master Guide)
- Complete project requirements and specifications
- All 30 repositories ranked by priority (Tier 1-6)
- Implementation instructions for every framework (Next.js, React, Vue, Angular, Django, Flask, Streamlit, WordPress, etc.)
- Code snippets ready to copy/paste
- Testing checklists
- Time estimates

### 2. **QUICK_START_CTA_GUIDE.md** (Fast Reference)
- Top 8 priority sites to tackle first
- 3-step implementation process
- Minified JavaScript code
- Quick framework-specific examples
- Testing checklist
- Commit message template

### 3. **CTA_IMPLEMENTATION_TRACKER.csv** (Progress Tracker)
- Spreadsheet with all 30 repos
- Priority rankings
- GitHub URLs and live URLs
- Columns to track: Status, Start Date, Completion Date, Time Spent, Issues, Verification
- Import into Excel/Google Sheets to track your progress

## 🔴 Phase 1: Priority Sites (Start Here)

**Please start with these 8 sites** (ranked by urgency):

### Critical - Custom Domains (2 sites)
1. ✅ **faithandpolicy.com** - https://github.com/IGTA-Tech/biblical-political-analyzer (Private)
2. ✅ **placementsproposal.com** - https://github.com/IGTA-Tech/placement-investment-proposal (Private)

### High Priority - Live Deployments (6 sites)
3. 🌐 https://lido-partnership-proposal.netlify.app - https://github.com/IGTA-Tech/lido-proposal
4. 🌐 https://visa-glow-tool.netlify.app - https://github.com/IGTA-Tech/visa-glow-tool (Private)
5. 🌐 https://spaces-by-premier.netlify.app - https://github.com/IGTA-Tech/spaces-by-premier
6. 🌐 https://evaluation-tool-jacksonwink.netlify.app - https://github.com/IGTA-Tech/evaluation-tool-jacksonwink (Private)
7. 🌐 https://p2025-theta.vercel.app - https://github.com/IGTA-Tech/p2025
8. 🌐 https://multi-brand-email-automation.netlify.app - https://github.com/IGTA-Tech/multi-brand-email-automation

**Estimated time for Phase 1:** 3-4 hours

## 🟡 Phase 2: Remaining Sites (Optional)

After completing the top 8, we have **14 additional sites** (staging sites + production apps without live deployments) that can be done if you have capacity. See the full brief for details.

**Estimated time for Phase 2:** 10-15 hours

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation (Super Quick Version)

**For each repo:**

1. **Add JavaScript file:** `public/ia-support-cta.js` (code in QUICK_START_CTA_GUIDE.md)
2. **Wire it up:** Add 2 script tags to root layout/template (examples for every framework provided)
3. **Add docs:** Small README section documenting the feature
4. **Test:** Button appears, links work, keyboard accessible, no UI conflicts
5. **Commit:** Use template message provided in the docs
6. **Deploy & Verify:** Check live site

**Average time per site:** 20-40 minutes

## 📊 Deliverables

For each site you complete, please:

✅ Implement the CTA button
✅ Test locally (checklist in docs)
✅ Commit with proper message (template provided)
✅ Push to repository
✅ Verify on live deployment
✅ Update the progress tracker CSV

**At the end:**
- Send me the completed CSV tracker
- List any issues or blockers encountered
- Screenshots of 2-3 live sites with the button visible (optional but nice to have)

## 🚨 Important Notes

**Private Repositories:** You'll need access to 11 private repos. Let me know if you encounter any access issues and I'll grant permissions immediately.

**Tech Stack Variety:** Our repos use different frameworks (Next.js, React, Vue, etc.). The brief includes specific instructions for each - you'll need to identify the tech stack first before implementing.

**Special Cases:**
- **Streamlit apps** (1 repo) - Different approach needed (inline HTML)
- **CLI tools** (1 repo) - Skip these (no web UI)
- **Documentation repos** (3 repos) - Skip these

**Git Workflow:**
- You can commit directly to `main`/`master` branch
- OR create feature branches (`feat/support-cta`) if you prefer - up to you

## ⏰ Timeline

**Phase 1 (Top 8):** [Your preferred deadline - suggest 2-3 days]
**Phase 2 (Remaining):** [Your preferred deadline - suggest 1-2 weeks]

Let me know what timeline works for you.

## 💰 Compensation

[Add your payment terms here - hourly rate, fixed price, etc.]

**Estimated:**
- Phase 1 (8 sites): 3-4 hours × $[rate] = $[amount]
- Phase 2 (14 sites): 10-15 hours × $[rate] = $[amount]

## 📞 Questions & Support

**Before you start, please:**
1. Review all 3 documents
2. Confirm you have access to the private repos
3. Let me know your estimated timeline for Phase 1
4. Ask any questions you have

**During implementation:**
- Slack/Email me if you hit any blockers
- Share progress updates (use the CSV tracker)
- Flag any repos that need special handling

**GitHub Organization:** https://github.com/IGTA-Tech

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

I'll consider Phase 1 complete when:
- All 8 priority sites have the CTA button live
- Button is properly styled and functional
- No visual conflicts with existing UI
- All sites pass the testing checklist
- Documentation added to each README
- Progress tracker CSV is updated

## 🎯 Success Looks Like

When you're done, visitors to our top sites will see a subtle, professional "Support & Build With Us" button that:
- Doesn't disrupt the existing design
- Works perfectly on mobile and desktop
- Is keyboard accessible
- Links to our support hub
- Can be configured via environment variables

This will give us a consistent support touchpoint across all our properties.

*P.S. - The full brief is very detailed (covers every framework and edge case), so don't be intimidated by the length. Most sites will follow the same pattern (Next.js/React), making implementation quick once you've done the first 1-2.*
